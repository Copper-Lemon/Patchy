### Linux

Paste this into a terminal. It installs Patchy for your user from the Patchy Flatpak
repository and pulls the shared KDE runtime from Flathub. No root needed.

```sh
flatpak install --user -y https://rtsoft.com/flatpak/com.rtsoft.patchy.flatpakref
```

Patchy then updates with `flatpak update` or through your software center, and starts
from your application menu or with `flatpak run com.rtsoft.patchy`.

This needs the `flatpak` tool. If needed, install it first with
`sudo apt install flatpak`.

The `.flatpakref` link in the table downloads a small file that a Flatpak-aware
software center (GNOME Software, KDE Discover) can open to install Patchy. Ubuntu has
none by default, and on Ubuntu 24.04 GNOME Software's Open button fails to start
Flatpak apps, so use the terminal command above instead.

The single-file bundle is the same build, for when you would rather download a file
first. Install it with `flatpak install --user -y PatchyLinux.flatpak`. It still fetches
the KDE runtime from Flathub, and it updates from the same repository afterwards.

My flatpak knowledge is limited, so I hope all this makes sense.  I hope to submit Patchy to Flathub eventually, but for now we have our own repository.

## Features

[Full feature list and format support](docs/features.md) · [Scripting guide](scripts/bundled/scripting-guide.md) · [AI control setup](docs/ai-control.md)

**Local by design.** No telemetry, tracking, or uploads of your images. The browser build
runs the same editor locally through WebAssembly. Desktop builds have more memory
available and add printing, scanner/camera import, and command-line automation.
Optional update checks contact GitHub, as do the Windows one-click update and Object Selection's High Quality model, each downloaded only if you ask for it. Twelve interface languages, dark and light
schemes, and importable themes are included.

## PSD compatibility, measured

In the [October 9, 2026 Testy v2 run](https://www.rtsoft.com/testy/2026-10-09/),
Patchy opened **all 309 files** of the psd-tools test collection, and Photoshop
reopened **every Patchy save** with **all 43 text objects, 183 adjustment layers,
172 Smart Objects, and 181 live effects** kept. Patchy's perceptual render match
was **92.7%**, the highest of the eight programs tested against Photoshop's
reference, using commit `53f81dfd`.

Testy v2 scores each program on what it draws itself: the baked pixels Photoshop
stores for text, shapes, fills, and Smart Objects are removed first. That is
stricter than the August run, so the two sets of numbers are not comparable.

These are dated, corpus-specific results. The linked report has every file's
renders and difference maps for all nine columns. Read the
[full comparison and methodology](docs/psd-compatibility-benchmark.md) for the
tables, per-folder results, scoring rules, and limitations.

**Know the limits:** editing is RGB at 8, 16, or 32 bits per channel (the browser
build stops at 16). CMYK, Lab, and the other color modes convert to RGB on open, and
there is no GPU acceleration. Unsupported Smart Filters can remain preview-locked,
and Affinity import has format-specific limitations. See [current compatibility](docs/features.md#current-status).

## What's New

### 1.10 - October 13, 2026

- Windows: one-click updates. Starting with the release after this one, the update prompt can download the new version, close Patchy, install it and start it again. It asks about unsaved work first and needs no administrator rights. Copies unpacked from the zip still get the browser download
- Updating no longer requires closing Claude, Codex or other AI apps connected to Patchy. They keep working on the old version, Patchy tells you which apps to restart, and the assistant is told as well. Assistants also hear when a new release is out, for people who only use Patchy through one
- Object Selection: an optional High Quality model finds objects much more accurately. It is a 234 MB download, offered the first time you use the tool and managed in Preferences. Dragging a box now analyzes just that area for sharper edges, and Select Object is back in the selection right-click menu
- Web build: Object Selection now works in the browser
- Copy Merged keeps the shape of the selection, and filters, adjustments and their previews blend soft selection edges instead of cutting them off. Script `applyFilter` honors the selection too

### 1.09 - October 12, 2026

- Object Selection tool (desktop): drag a box or click an object and Patchy selects it
- File > File Info: view, edit and strip image metadata. EXIF, XMP, IPTC, ICC profiles and text chunks are read from every format, kept on save, and Export can keep all metadata, only the copyright, or none. Scripts get `fileInfo` and `stripMetadata`
- Windows installer: can now choose the install folder ([issue 85](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/85))
- macOS: fixed bug where arrow-key nudges with the Move tool didn't work on a physical keyboard, and the hover outline follows the nudged layer ([issue 84](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/84))
- Text layers in some older PSDs (Photoshop CS5 era) can be edited again instead of all showing as protected ([issue 86](https://github.com/SethRobinson/Patchy/issues/86))
- PSD compatibility pass: CMYK layers composite in their own ink channels, CMYK, grayscale and 16-bit saves keep their native color space, and knockout transparency, aligned vector stroke edges, grayscale Smart Objects, duotone inks and noise gradients render closer to Photoshop
- Saves and automatic document recovery hold up better against crashes and power loss

[Older releases](RELEASE-HISTORY.md)

## Photoshop plug-ins (.8bf, Windows only)

Choose **Plugins > Open Plug-ins Folder**, copy your `.8bf` files and their supporting
files into it, then choose **Plugins > Rescan Plug-in Folders**. Both 32-bit and 64-bit
filters appear under **Plugins > Legacy Photoshop Plug-ins**.

Filters run on the active pixel layer, respect the selection, and apply as one undoable
step. A separate helper isolates plug-in crashes. Plug-ins still run with your user
permissions, so install only ones you trust. KPT and other formerly full-screen filters
get a bounded, movable window. [Plug-in details](docs/plugins.md).

## AI Disclosure

This project was developed with significant assistance from AI tools.  I mean, you can still blame me (Seth) for bugs, but I just wanted to mention it.

Note:  All included textures/materials are real images taken by humans, not AI generated

## Missing features / contributions?

AI has reached the point where you can use your favorite AI agent to add the missing feature you want.

Just give it the link to this repo and tell it "read AGENTS.md and add feature X to this project".  It will read the code, read the tests, and add the feature.

I mean, that's kind the power of open source, amplified.

Whatever AI you use (the smarter the better), tell it (or more likely, it's reading this right now) to read AGENTS.md before doing anything else. It contains the build and repository-wide rules, then routes feature work to the relevant document under `docs/`.

There are 2800+ regression and benchmarking tests. AGENTS.md links agents to the testing guide that explains how to select and run them.  Due to the size of some of the test files I use they aren't all included, it will skip tests that require missing files.\
\
I probably don't want any major features coming from outside, as there are wrong and right ways to do things, some of it a bit subjective. Remember, you can always go crazy in your own fork, have some fun!\
\
If you have a bug fix or feature you think fits this project's scope please open an issue or tweet/etc at me.  If you want to submit a pull request, please look at the actual code and fully TEST IT YOURSELF before submitting, and if possible include screenshots of the actual changes so it's clear what you're doing.  If you're using AI, use a good one (Fable/Astra+ class), we don't want barely working slop.

Don't trust AI to create and submit PRs with no oversight, I'll delete ones that have too much AI smell.  Smell human.  This is starting to sound weird but you know what I mean.\
\
Also, note that certain features are crippled or not included due to Adobe patents.  For example, our "quick select" tool doesn't update in realtime, you have to finish the stroke.  We can revisit this around 2030 when the patents expire...
